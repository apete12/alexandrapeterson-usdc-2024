// Data:
    // scannedTextObject is an array of objects
    // data needed from scannedTextObj: ISBN, Page, and Text for each Content object that is a positive search result
    // Content key/value pair: array of objects

// Strategy: 
    // iterate through parent array, access Content array of objects
    // iterate through Content array, access Content.Text
    // conditional: if Content.Text includes searchTerm, push requested data to result.Results array

// Note: 
    // For positive search, object pushed to result.Results should include ISBN, Page, and Text --> construct new object
